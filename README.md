# Mimir
 The system that powers Valhalla and all it's features.
 
 Mimir is a large system that at it's core exists as a Discord Bot but with a toolset to collect data from various sources and make it avaiiable to the community. 
 
 This reposity exists as a place to track issues related to Mimir and to publish various "functions" that can be collaborated on to improve functionality of parts of the system. These functions are in the `functions` directory and the data that they utilize is in `data-sammples`. Eventually an API will be published that will allow the community to collaborate on plugins to utilize some of the more advanced abilities of Mimir such as polling chart data and calculating signals.
