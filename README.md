# Mimir

### The system that powers Valhalla and all it's features.

Mimir is a large system that at it's core exists as a trading community oriented Discord Bot but with a toolset to collect data from various sources and make it available to the community.

The system is built with [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) a tool for rapid development. This repository hosts a development project with endpoints to the core application (Mimir Core) built-in.

### Contributing
The development install can be accessed at [https://dev.ascendedtrading.com:1880](https://dev.ascendedtrading.com:1880/). In order to log in click `Login with Discord` and use your Discord account to authenticate. The account must currently be in **Valhalla** ([invite](https://discord.gg/ascendedtrading)).

Accounts by default have read-only privileges, if you'd like access to contribute you can request it via Discord by using `@Conqueror` or by joining the **Valhalla Dev** Discord server ([invite](https://discord.gg/NMFKTW8ePr)).

While **Mimir Core** is closed source, contributions to the community are welcomed as bits of code may be made available for improvement from time to time and any new features built within the dev environment will receive proper attribution.
